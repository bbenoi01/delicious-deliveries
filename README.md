Delicious Deliveries is a full stack concept restaurant ordering website, which was developed as a one week group project.  As a customer on the website, you can browse through different restaurants in your area, view their menus, add menu items the shopping cart, edit the shopping cart review your order and checkout.  As a restaurant owner, you can add and update restaurants to Delicious Deliveries, as well as add new menu items to be diplayed at a chosen restaurant.  Our database was made using MongoDB with Loopback.  Future updates will include swipe payment integration, an order history for customers to reorder past orders and an owners ability to set a max item quantity per order.

The project is generated by [Delicious Deliveries](https://delicious-deliveries.herokuapp.com).
